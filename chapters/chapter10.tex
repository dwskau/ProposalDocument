\label{conclusion}

Our model presents a novel way to approach visualization design, and to support creativity.
Visualization primitives in conjunction with visual properties create an environment optimized for rapidly prototyping new visualization techniques.
The environment supports instant visual feedback and helps to develop an efficient flow for visualization design.

The theoretical contributions of this model are based on a cognitive argument that is closely aligned with visualization theory.
Our study shows considerable interest in and potential for the creation of new visualizations using visualization primitives.

The most compelling argument for this approach is the control and flexibility given to non-technical users who want to create novel visualizations.
We hope that some of the principles it presents can be integrated into existing and future visualization and visual analytics tools.
