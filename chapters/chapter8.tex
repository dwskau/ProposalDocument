\label{futureWork}

Putting the lessons learned into practice is the next step of the process.
The publication opportunities that are most appropriate for this work set the timeline for improvements to the interface and conducting studies.
The next feasible deadline is early December 2013.
To prepare for this deadline, and future deadlines beyond it, the interface needs to be given a lot of attention.
I would like to achieve all of the interface improvements in Section~\ref{interfaceImprovements}.
This puts the implementation on a good footing to have several studies run against it with only minor changes between each study.

The study design needs to be adjusted heavily to account for the addition of the CAT, and to encourage participants to complete the tasks more thoroughly.
Providing a task will help with completion.
One possible task would be showing three visualizations that show airlines that have fewer delays, using an Airline On-Time Performance dataset.
Another possible task is creating three visualizations that show data dimensions that correlate with miles per gallon in a dataset on cars.
A concrete task will provide participants with boundaries and restrictions, giving them restrictions to be creative within.
The task will also make it possible to judge how creative their solutions are.

It may also be important to run the study with individuals in a lab setting rather than over the internet.
This also makes it simpler to monetarily reward participants for their participation, and provide further motivation.
I can ensure that the participant fully understands the interface, and has an opportunity to ask questions before they are left to the task.
It also means browser compatibility will not be an issue.

Using contacts in the visualization domain, I have access to a handful of students studying visualization, as well as a large collection of information designers working in the visualization space.
The student members of this group may be pulled from data visualization classes at UC Berkeley, and the designers may be pulled from a pool of contacts I have through my work at Visually.
This group provides a set of participants that are likely familiar with data visualization concepts, with a high likelihood of being able to perform creative tasks using the tool.

The study will begin with an information session on the tool and the components of its interface.
Participants will be trained on how to make a simple visualization, and how to connect primitives together.
Following that, they will be given a time period of free exploration where they can explore the interface at their will, and ask questions freely.
After a short period of time, they will be presented with the task(s), and asked to solve it (them).
Once they have completed the assignment, they will be given the CSI to answer before their participation in the study concludes.

The expert judges will also be drawn from my contacts through Visually.
They will be chosen based on their expertise in visualization, and will come from both the academic realm (professors of data visualization), and from practicing leaders in the field.
They will be monetarily rewarded for their participation in the study.
An interface will be provided to allow the judges to rate the graphics over the internet.
The judges will be trained, either in person, or over a video call, on the rating system, and on how to use the interface rate each participant produced visualization.
The judges will be instructed to do these activities alone, without consultation with others, to ensure they do not influence each other.

Studies beyond this one will be based somewhat on the results of the study, but the main goals will be to establish the creativity support of the visualization primitives model.
Another possible angle to examine is whether the model supports creativity better because of how closely it matches the mental model of visualization creators.
If this turns out to be true, then the work will make a significant contribution to our understanding of information visualization, and can be used in the development of visualization theory.
